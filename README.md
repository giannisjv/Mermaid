This is my plank theme.<p>
This works with plank https://launchpad.net/plank <p>
You can clone it to your /home directory <p>
  $ git clone 
Then you have to move it <p> $ mv ~/.local/share/plank/themes <p>
  The last thing is to open preferences with <p>
  $ plank --preferences 
  <p> and you are good to go! ;-)
